## Features

* **Precise Fluid Delivery (10â€“20 mL syringes).** Compatible with multiple syringe sizes, ensuring controlled flow rates and repeatable dosing.  
* **User-Friendly Controls.** Includes start/pause button, forward/reverse jog buttons, and LED indicators (green = running, yellow = paused, red = empty).  
* **Stepper Motor with Microstepping.** NEMA 17 motor coupled with lead screw provides stable motion and minimized vibration.  
* **Safety Enclosure.** PLA housing protects electronics from finger contact and water intrusion.  
* **Replaceable Syringes.** Quick setup with adjustable carriage supports for various syringe diameters.

## Operation

1. Plug in the power supply.  
2. Mount syringe(s) into the support and adjust carriage to contact plunger.  
3. Use **forward/reverse buttons** to set syringe position.  
4. Set flow rate in Arduino code (or via serial input).  
5. Press **start button** to begin (LED turns **green**).  
6. Press start again to pause (LED turns **yellow**).  
7. When syringe empties, **red LED** lights. Replace syringe and reset.
